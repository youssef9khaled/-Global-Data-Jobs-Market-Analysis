# 📊 Global Data Jobs Market Analysis

## 🎯 Project Overview
Comprehensive analysis of global data job postings to extract actionable strategies for individuals seeking careers in data-related fields.

**Tools Used:** Power BI, Power Query, Data Visualization, DAX

## 🔍 Data Jobs Posting Analysis

### 🎯 Objective
To clean and analyze global data job postings in order to extract actionable strategies for individuals seeking careers in data-related fields.

### 🧹 Data Preparation (Using Power Query)

#### ✅ Cleaning Steps:
- Checked for duplicate and null values using the View tab in Power Query to ensure data cleanliness
- Removed duplicates using the Remove Duplicates feature
- Identified null values: Most nulls stem from missing details in job postings rather than data collection errors

#### 🧩 Data Transformation:
- Created two new tables:
  - **Job Skills**
  - **Job Schedule Type**
- Using the Split Column and Split to Rows features

#### 💡 Why this was done:
- Original data had multiple skills and schedules in a single cell, making analysis difficult
- Splitting this into rows in new tables made analysis clearer and more granular
